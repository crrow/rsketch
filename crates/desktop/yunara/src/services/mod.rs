//! Business service modules
//!
//! Each service module should define:
//! - A service handler struct (e.g., UserServiceHandler)
//! - An extension trait for AppState (e.g., UserServiceExt)
//!
//! This keeps the code modular and allows each service to be developed
//! independently.

// Example service module (commented out until needed)
// pub mod user_service;

// Re-export extension traits for convenience
// pub use user_service::UserServiceExt;
