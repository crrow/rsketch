// ============================================================================
// Fallible Worker Trait (Recommended)
// ============================================================================

/// Worker trait with error handling support.
///
/// This is the recommended trait for implementing workers. It allows returning
/// errors from lifecycle hooks which are handled by the runtime:
/// - **Transient errors**: Logged and worker continues to next execution
/// - **Fatal errors**: Logged and worker stops after calling `on_shutdown()`
///
/// # Type Parameter
///
/// The state type `S` is specified at trait level, allowing the worker to know
/// the concrete state type at compile time.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use rsketch_common_worker::{FallibleWorker, WorkerContext, WorkResult, WorkError};
///
/// struct DatabaseCleanup;
///
/// #[async_trait::async_trait]
/// impl FallibleWorker<AppState> for DatabaseCleanup {
///     async fn work(&mut self, ctx: WorkerContext<AppState>) -> WorkResult {
///         let db = ctx.state().db.clone();
///
///         db.cleanup_old_records().await.map_err(|e| {
///             WorkError::transient_with_source("Database cleanup failed", e)
///         })?;
///
///         Ok(())
///     }
/// }
/// # #[derive(Clone)] struct AppState { db: std::sync::Arc<Db> }
/// # struct Db;
/// # impl Db { async fn cleanup_old_records(&self) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> { Ok(()) } }
/// ```

    /// Called once when the worker starts, before the first work execution.
    ///
    /// If this returns a fatal error, the worker will not start and

    /// Core work unit, called according to the trigger schedule.

    /// - Return `Err(WorkError::transient(...))` for recoverable errors
    /// - Return `Err(WorkError::fatal(...))` to stop the worker

// ============================================================================
// Legacy Worker Trait (Deprecated)
// ============================================================================

/// Core worker trait defining execution logic and lifecycle hooks.
///
/// Workers are stateful tasks that execute according to a trigger schedule.
/// The trait is deliberately simple - configuration (name, trigger, blocking)
/// is handled by the builder API, not by trait methods.
///
/// # Generic State
///
/// All methods are generic over state type `S` to allow the same Worker
/// implementation to work with different state types. The Manager determines
/// the concrete state type.
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// 1. `on_start` - Called once before first work execution
/// 2. `work` - Called repeatedly according to trigger schedule
/// 3. `on_shutdown` - Called once during graceful shutdown
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use rsketch_common_worker::{Worker, WorkerContext};
///
/// struct MyWorker {
///     counter: std::sync::Arc<std::sync::atomic::AtomicUsize>,
/// }
///
/// #[async_trait::async_trait]
/// impl Worker for MyWorker {
///     async fn on_start<S: Clone + Send + Sync>(&mut self, ctx: WorkerContext<S>) {
///         println!("Worker {} starting", ctx.name());
///     }
///
///     async fn work<S: Clone + Send + Sync>(&mut self, ctx: WorkerContext<S>) {
///         self.counter
///             .fetch_add(1, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst);
///
///         // Check for cancellation
///         if ctx.is_cancelled() {
///             return;
///         }
///     }
///
///     async fn on_shutdown<S: Clone + Send + Sync>(&mut self, ctx: WorkerContext<S>) {
///         println!("Worker {} shutting down", ctx.name());
///     }
/// }
