///
/// ```rust
/// use std::sync::Arc;
///
/// use rsketch_common_worker::WorkerContext;
///
/// #[derive(Clone)]
/// struct AppState {
///     db:     Arc<Database>, // Expensive type wrapped in Arc
///     config: String,        // Cheap to clone
/// }
///
/// async fn work_fn<S: Clone + Send + Sync>(ctx: WorkerContext<S>) {
